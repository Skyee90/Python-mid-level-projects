# So the first thing is i have to understand the process then break the processs what should be at first what next like that...
# and i have feel the code to do that i need to open my heart for love and that felling will chnage everything like that ok .....


# so now the first part is begiing like this :-
#  1> Load Encrypytion Key 
#  2> Add a Pass Word
# 3> save to file
# 4> decryption
# 5> View Pass
# 6> Show it wit random colors  


# Now the separation is almost ready we need to create a mental flow chart so imagine it foe final time with heart ful of emotion tol make it real and  meaningfull...

# Now the logic part we need to make to flow our emotion into life :-
# like  For encryption needs Fernet
# Save everything in json file
# Every breaked part or chunk i just wrote all of them are are just different function
# like this [def add_pass ():]

# Now th last part i have to debug the code mentally to understand what could go wrong
# everything that i can think could go wrong is how that thing will make it stonger and make my code more stronger for next project 
# and thats how i will make my logic stronger than everest and depth more than mariana trench..
# And the belief i can do this will only tell me what could go wrong and that is the thing i nneed to make strong an stronger for next project......
